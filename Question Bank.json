			"Question":"Most of the commercial buildings in Hong Kong use District Cooling System.",
			"Choice":["A. True","B. False"],
			"Ans":"B",

			"Question":"Is the price of District Cooling System expensive?",
			"Choice":["A. True","B. False"],
			"Ans":"B",
			"Elaborations":"In 2013/2014, the price of District Cooling System is similar to the conventional central air-conditioning systems separately installed in individual buildings. With the development of District Cooling System, the price tends to fall."

			"Question":"What is Urban Heat Island Effect?",
			"Choice":["A. Cities experience much warmer temperatures than nearby rural areas.","B. Rural areas are warmer than nearby cities to affect these cities’ temperature.","C. Both cities and rural areas are very hot.","D. There is lots of pollution in the city."],
			"Ans":"A",
			"Elaborations":"An urban heat island occurs when a city experiences much warmer temperatures than nearby rural areas. The difference in temperature between urban and less-developed rural areas has to do with how well the surfaces in each environment absorb and hold heat."

			"Question":"How can the District Cooling System reduce the Urban Heat Island Effect?",
			"Choice":["A. It cools down the cities to reduce the temperature.","B. It saves the cost and the firms can have more capital for environment.","C. It saves the area to plant trees, other vegetation etc.","D. The factory of the District Cooling System can reduce the Urban Heat Island Effect."],
			"Ans":"C",
			"Elaborations":"Method of reducing Urban Heat Island Effect: \n 1. Build green infrastructure improvements into regular street upgrades and capital improvement projects to ensure continued investment in heat-reducing practices.\n\n2. Plant trees and other vegetation. \n\n3. Build green roofs—Green roofs are an ideal heat island reduction strategy, providing both direct and ambient cooling effects.  In addition, green roofs improve air quality by reducing the heat island effect and absorbing pollutants.\n\n\nFor the District Cooling System : No vibration / noise, reduce heat island effect, more flexible building design e.g. green roof, since no chiller plant is required."
